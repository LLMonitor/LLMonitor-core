## 1. Install the SDK

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']} label='Package Installation'>

```bash tab="npm"
npm install @llmonitor/sdk
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm install @llmonitor/sdk
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn add @llmonitor/sdk
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun add @llmonitor/sdk
```

</Tabs>

## 2. Create an API Key

Go to [llmonitor.io dashboard](https://llmonitor.io) and create a new API key for your project.

## 3. Wrap your instance

Wrap your instance and pass the API key:

```javascript
import { LLMonitor } from "@llmonitor/sdk";

const monitor = new LLMonitor({
    apiKey: "your-api-key"
})

// Wrap your instance to automatically track events
const openai = monitor.openai(new OpenAI(...))

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages: [
    { role: "user", content: "Hello, world!" }
  ]
})
```

<Callout type="info" title="Resilient by Design">
  If LLMonitor goes down or fails for any reason, your requests will still
  execute normally. The monitoring is non-blocking and won't affect your
  application's performance or reliability.
