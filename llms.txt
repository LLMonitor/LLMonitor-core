# LLMonitor - LLM Observability & Cost Intelligence

## Overview
LLMonitor is an observability and cost analysis platform for applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a centralized dashboard to monitor performance, cost, and behavior of LLM interactions across different providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, and DeepSeek.

## Architecture
- **Monorepo** with apps and packages structure
- **SDK** for client application integration
- **Server** for data processing and storage
- **Web client** for data visualization
- **Documentation** to guide users

## Supported LLM Providers
- OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc.)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Google (Gemini)
- Cohere
- DeepSeek

## Key Features

### LLM Event Logging
- Capture of complete metadata for each LLM interaction
- Storage of prompts, completions, token usage, and costs
- Tracking of latency and response status

### Cost Calculation
- Automatic cost estimation based on models and tokens
- Support for different pricing structures by provider
- Real-time expense visibility

### Performance Analysis
- Latency and token usage metrics
- Success and error rates
- Anomaly detection and alerts

### A/B Testing
- Version tagging to compare prompt variants
- Comparative analysis of performance and costs

### Simple Integration
- Wrappers for existing LLM API clients
- Middleware for Express
- Minimal configuration required

## Technical Integration

### SDK
The SDK provides wrappers for API clients from different LLM providers:

```typescript
// Example of OpenAI integration
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { LLMonitor } from "@llmonitor/sdk";

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: "your-openai-key" });
const monitor = new LLMonitor({ apiKey: "your-llmonitor-key" });
const monitoredOpenAI = monitor.openai(openai);

// Use exactly like the normal OpenAI client
const response = await monitoredOpenAI.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});
```

### Data Structure
Each LLM event records:
- Provider and model used
- Configuration (temperature, max_tokens, etc.)
- Complete prompt and completion
- Token count (prompt and completion)
- Latency in milliseconds
- Response status
- Estimated cost in USD
- Additional customizable metadata

### Data Flow
1. The client application makes a call to an LLM through the SDK wrapper
2. The wrapper intercepts the call, processes it normally, and captures all metadata
3. Data is sent to the LLMonitor server
4. The server processes, enriches, and stores the data
5. Data can be visualized in the web dashboard

## Security and Privacy
- API key-based authentication
- Support for organizations and roles (RBAC)
- Data encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest

## Use Cases
- LLM cost optimization
- Performance issue detection
- Comparison of different models and providers
- Experimentation with different prompting strategies
- Usage and budget monitoring
